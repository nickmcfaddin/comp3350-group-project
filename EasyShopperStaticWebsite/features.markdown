Feature descriptions laid out in chronological order with regards to implementation.

### Manage Lists
The main page of our site. This page allows users to see all of their shopping lists labeled with our affiliated stores. They can add and remove lists from here as well as add and delete products from their available lists.

### Product Prices
With the implementation of this feature, users can now see the price of each of their products at each store. In addition to this, they can see list totals.

### Search Function
Allows shoppers to search for a product and get more information regarding that product such as nutritional facts and prices at competing stores.

### Manage Home Storage
Acts as an inventory for home owners. From this page, they can track what products they have at their house, and increment/decrement that amount along with the amount they want to have (desired quantity).

### Product Expiry Dates
Adding on to our home storage feature, users can now see the expiry dates associated with each of the products in their inventory, making it easy to know what to throw out and to plan their shopping accordingly.

### Request Lists
Request lists add a whole other dimension to the application, allowing others to use the device to add a request list, labeled with their name. The main device owner will be able to go through these request lists and approve/deny the requests from subusers, similar to the function of a Git merge request.

### Share Lists
This feature allows users to share their lists with others by converting them to a pdf/image format that is sendable via messaging applications.
