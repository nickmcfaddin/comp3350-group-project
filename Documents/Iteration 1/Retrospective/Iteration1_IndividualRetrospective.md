# Iteration 1 Individual Retrospective

## Leeroy 
* What did you do well?
    * One thing I did well in this iteration was creating and designing most of the app’s interface.
* What is your best code?
    * I would say the best code I have written in this iteration is the ShoppingListAdapter class, which is responsible for creating a view for an expandable list in our interface. The reason why I am so proud of this code is that I was able to use my knowledge of Android Studio to its full extent, being able to create a list view based on our own defined class and creating a delete prompt dialogue when a user holds on a list item.

## Nick McFaddin
* What did you do well?
    * Something I did well in this iteration was organising our group’s repository and dealing with nearly all of the documentation and display of our markdown files.
* What is your best code? 
    * My best code was created while working on our item popup GUI. This popup displays information about a product including its name, nutritional facts and competing store prices. Both the [XML file](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/comp3350-winter2024/lethalcompany-a01-13/-/blob/main/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_product_view.xml?ref_type=heads) and the [Java file](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/comp3350-winter2024/lethalcompany-a01-13/-/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/example/easyshopper/presentation/ProductViewActivity.java?ref_type=heads) in the presentation layer were things I was proud to work on. 

## Kevin (Hung Tran) 
* What did you do well? 
    * One thing I did well in this iteration was writing the persistence and persistence stub classes and services class to connect with the database, as well as writing some of the Unit Tests for objects and cleaning up necessary code from classes with Nick.
* What is your best code? 
    * My best code is figuring out how to interact with UI Testing units for the latest Android Studio version and SDK, as the UI Testing in the sample ECookBook is outdated.

        * [SearchFragmentTest](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/comp3350-winter2024/lethalcompany-a01-13/-/blob/main/app/src/androidTest/java/com/example/easyshopper/SearchFragmentTest.java?ref_type=heads)

## Jarett 
* What did you do well? 
    * One thing i did well this iteration was writing part of the Prodcut handeler class and its tests.
* What is your best code? 
    * My best code was my tests for the productHander as I needed some help with connecting the layers for the hander code itself.
