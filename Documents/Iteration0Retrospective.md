# Iteration 0 Retrospective
Our team thought that iteration 0 went very well. Throughout the iteration, we did a good job of communicating with each other. We setup weekly meetings that will be ongoing to the end of the term. This was a key to success for us as it kept us on the same page and allowed us to connect more. We also stressed the importance of attendance, as with all of us being in class each day it gives us more time to talk about our ideas, and any questions we may have.

There wasn't much to critique in this iteration as we all attended everything and stayed on task during our meetings. We did touch on some things that we wanted to keep in mind for the future and to strive towards. The first of these is to be comfortable having tough conversations. If one of us aren't pulling our weight then making sure to address that early on so that it does not become a major problem. Secondly is to be accountable. Even if we have things going on, others do too, so making sure that we respect each others time as well as our own. Lastly is to try to step up when we can. There are going to be times where each of us are too busy to be able to finish something and in those cases it is important that the team steps up to help out as they would want the same done for them.
